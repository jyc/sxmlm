# sxmlm

A small module for converting SXML-like expressions (probably made using [ppx_sexp](https://bitbucket.org/jyc/ppx_sexp)) to a format that can be used with the Xmlm library.

## xmlm_of_sexp

`xmlm_of_sexp` takes an SXML-like S-expression in the format generated by
ppx_sexp and returns it as a value `x` suitable for use with
`Xmlm.output_doc_tree id out (dtd, x)`, where `id` is the identity
function, `out` is an Xmlm output, and `dtd` is an Xmlm DTD.

An optional argument `sigil` is accepted, defaulting to "~+" (what +
expands to in the AST when used in expressions of the form `+ a b ...`).
This is the identifier for alists of tag attributes. For example, with the
default attribute sigil, inside of an sexp application:

    (html (+ (lang "en"))
       (head
          (title "My webpage"))
    (body
       (h1 "Welcome to my webpage")))

SXML uses @, which we can't use due to it not being valid OCaml syntax.
